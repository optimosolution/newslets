                <p class="space-20 text-justify">Branding is a process of building reputation, maintaining reputation, and possibly increasing reputation with necessary stake-holders. Branding is a force seen and felt. No product or business ever born with a brand name. <strong>Branding is a specific personal journey.</strong> The destination may seem far, but reachable only with constantly engaged marketing efforts.</p>
                <p class="space-20 text-justify">There is a general misconception about branding, that, only multinational or wider marketing perimeter constitutes branding, which is not true at all. <strong>Branding must belong to the core of the business, not to the size or scale of the business.</strong> Your creativity in using the capacities of Newslets as communication medium will add up success in branding of reputation of your business. <strong>Try to recognize the power of Posts Flow Model of Newslets and use this model creatively.</strong></p> 
                <p class="space-20 text-justify">Newslets is designed with "local factors" in mind. Each business has to survive on the customers who reside within a radius. That's the core support each business needs to communicate effectively. Effective communication is only possible when distri-bution of Posts and Updates are 100% confirmed, and free from monetization.</p>

                    <h4 class="space-40">Freelancers and Professionals as Brands</h4>
                    <p class="space-30 text-justify">At present Freelancers/Professionals mostly work at different Marketplaces which provide jobs and clients. Thay bid for each and every job posted by any client. At times unlimited Free-lancers and Professionals from multiple countries bid for the same job. As a result huge amount of pre-bid Manpower Time invested in 1 single job which only 1 person does later on. </p>
                    <p class="space-30 text-justify">Only beneficiary of this process is the owner of Marketplace who try to bring prices down as low as possible for the benefit of Clients. Because Marketplaces will continue to own Clients, so they designed the Marketplace similar to historical Slavery Model. Freelancers/Professionals are virtually in Holding Pen. Freelancers/Professionals can never own a Client even after working for many years. </p>
