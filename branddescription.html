      <p class="margintop">Branding is a process of building reputation, maintaining reputation, and possibly increasing reputation with necessary stakeholders. Branding is a force seen and felt. No product or business ever born with a brand name.<strong> Branding is a specific personal journey.</strong> The destination may seem far, but reachable only with constantly engaged marketing efforts.</p>
      <p class="margintop">There is a general misconception about branding, that, only multinational or wider marketing perimeter constitutes branding,
        which is not true at all.<strong> Branding must belong to the core of the business,</strong> not to the size or scale of the business. Your
        creativity in using the capacities of Newslets as communication medium will add up success in branding of reputation of your
        business.<strong> Try to recognize the power of Posts Flow Model of Newslets and use this model creatively.</strong></p>

          <h4>Posts Flow Model of Newslets.com</h4>
          <h5 class="text-danger">100%+ Guaranteed Exposure of all Posts</h5>
        </div>

      <p class="margintop"><strong>What you get when you create an account as Brand(s)</strong> <br/>
        <b>1.</b>Platform will send your Posts simultaneously to both of your Following and Followers. <br/>
        <span class="text-primary">* Your contents get 100%+ free exposure organically with all of your Following.</span> <br/>
        <span class="text-danger">*Following > those who you are following to achieve your objectives.</span> <br/>
        <span class="text-primary">* Your contents get 100%+ free exposure from all of your Followers.</span> <br/>
        <span class="text-danger">*Followers > Those who are following you for their objectives on your Brand.</span> <br/>
      </p>
      <p class="margintop"><b>2.</b>You will be able to <strong>Post and Upload your Contents</strong> using <strong> special formatted Form </strong>consisting of Fields. You will <strong>select</strong> the lengths of your Posts from options of<strong> 99 words or 150 words or 200 words.</strong> You will be able to add
        picture/selfie/graphics/video to make your story appealing with contexts. You will also use Text Enhancing Contextual Emoticons for the taste of face-to-face communication. </p>
      <p class="margintop"><b>3.</b>Headlines of your <strong>Contents</strong> will be treated as <strong>Microblogs</strong> and will be send to Platform Universal Stream. <strong>Universal
        Stream consists of all the users of the Platform minus your Following and Followers.</strong><br/>
        When any User (<span class="text-danger"> being attracted to Headline of the Post</span> ) click on the Headline, Platform will <strong>render whole Post </strong>to
        read. So your Posts have tremendous possibilities for organic exposure and thereby <strong>grow added Followers</strong> post
        by post</p>
      <p class="margintop"><b> 4.</b>You will be able to build your total<strong> Following</strong> baseline according to Platform's principle of "Follower Acceptance by
        Default". When you select to Follow from Brand, Citizen Journalist, Organization, or Celeb categories, the <strong>request is
        accepted by Default. Platform dictates users to "Follow Objectively"</strong>.<br/>
        It means that quality of your Posts at<strong> reasonable Branding Frequency</strong> will keep your <strong>Following base </strong>also following you. It means you have larger customer baseline who will read whatever you prepare for them (<span class="text-danger"> Platform will
        send your posts again and again until it is opened</span> ).</p>
      <p class="margintop"><b> 5.</b>Your Dashboard has <strong>Analytics Section</strong> at the bottom. It is extremely robust. You will know how your last Post fetching <strong>Engagements from Following and Followers</strong>. Analytics will work like mirror of your presence in the social relations. </p>
      <p class="margintop"><b> 6.</b>Your existence as a Brand will manifest through<strong> Your Social Score</strong> which is achieved via <strong>Point Distribution System</strong> devised and applied by the Platform. Frequency of Posts, your Engagement level on others' Posts and others' Engagements on your Posts, your Defollow level an vice versa, quantiry of your Edit, Delete on Posts: these are actionable metrix for the Point Distribution System. </p>
      <h4>Freelancers as Brand</h4>
      <p class="margintop">At present Freelancers mostly work at different Marketplaces which provide jobs and clients. Freelancers bid for each
        and every job posted by any client. At times unlimited Freelancers from multiple countries bid for the same job. As a
        result huge amount of pre-bid Manpower Time invested in 1 single job which only 1 person does later on.<br/>
        Only beneficiary of this process is the owner of Marketplace who try to bring prices down as low as possible for the benefit of Clients. Because Marketplaces will continue to own Clients, so they designed the Marketplace similar to historical
        Slavery Model. Freelancers are virtually in Holding Pen. Freelancers can never own a Client even after working for many
        years. </p>
      <h4>How ?</h4>
      <p class="margintop"><strong>Open an Account </strong>with Newslets.com under Brand Category. A Dashboard will be allocated to your <strong>Name personalized as business/eCommerce</strong>.<br/>
        At the 1st Column of your dashboard, a Tab named <strong>Create Content</strong> is kept for <strong>easy Posting and Uploading</strong>. Once you
        Click on the Tab,<strong> specific Form</strong> will show up for your writing, add picture or video then submit for Upload as your Content.</p>
